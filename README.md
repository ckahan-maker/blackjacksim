# blackjacksim

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of **blackjacksim** is to make it easy to play and analyze
blackjack directly from the R console. Users can experiment with custom
strategies, modify dealer and table rules, and simulate large numbers of
hands to estimate performance. This package offers a reproducible
environment for studying how blackjack outcomes change under different
playing decisions and game conditions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of blackjacksim from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ckahan-maker/blackjacksim")
```

## Remaining Work

For the remainder of the semester, the main tasks include completing the
core blackjack rule implementations—such as splitting, doubling,
surrender logic, and dealer behavior—and finalizing the hand evaluation
and game-flow mechanics. The next steps also involve building the Monte
Carlo simulation engine, adding support for user-defined strategies, and
reporting key metrics like expected value and win/push rates. Additional
work includes implementing confidence interval estimation for these
metrics to quantify uncertainty in simulation results and developing a
simple interactive console mode.

## Example

``` r
# library(blackjacksim)
# Example code will be added here.
```
