Description: Provides tools to play and simulate casino Blackjack under customizable rule
    sets. Users can interactively play Blackjack in the R console or evaluate
    user-defined strategies through fast Monte Carlo simulation. The package
    supports flexible table configurations, including the number of decks, dealer
    behavior (such as standing or hitting on soft 17), payout structures,
    surrender rules, doubling and splitting options, and penetration levels. The
    simulation engine can run millions of hands to estimate expected value, win
    rate, push rate, and per-hand variance under arbitrary strategies. Methods are
    included for computing confidence intervals using both independent-hand and
    shoe-level clustering approaches. The framework is designed to support
    strategy experimentation, rule comparison, and exploration of how card
    composition affects optimal decisions in finite Blackjack shoes.
