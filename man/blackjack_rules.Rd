\arguments{
\item{payout}{Numeric. The payout ratio for a natural Blackjack. Common values are 1.5 (3:2) or 1.2 (6:5). Default is \code{1.5}.}

\item{dealer_stands_soft_17}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the dealer must stand on a Soft 17 (A-6). If \code{FALSE}, the dealer hits on Soft 17. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{num_decks}{Integer. The number of 52-card decks used in the shoe. Default is \code{6}.}

\item{penetration}{Numeric. A value between 0 and 1 representing the percentage of the shoe dealt before reshuffling. Default is \code{0.75}.}

\item{burn_cards}{Integer. The number of cards discarded from the top of the shoe after a shuffle. Default is \code{1}.}

\item{allow_insurance}{Logical. Whether the player is offered Insurance when the dealer shows an Ace. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{surrender}{Character. Options are \code{"none"}, \code{"early"}, or \code{"late"}. Defines if/when a player can forfeit their hand for half their bet. Default is \code{"none"}.}

\item{dealer_peeks}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the dealer checks their hole card for Blackjack before the player acts. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{european_no_hole}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the game is played with "European No Hole Card" rules (dealer receives no second card until player finishes). Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{double_on}{Character. Specifies which starting totals allow doubling down. Options: \code{"any"}, \code{"9,10,11"}, or \code{"10,11"}. Default is \code{"any"}.}

\item{double_after_split}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, doubling down is permitted after splitting a pair. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{max_splits}{Integer. The maximum number of times a hand can be split. Default is \code{3} (allowing up to 4 hands).}

\item{resplit_aces}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, a player can split Aces again if they draw another Ace. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{hit_split_aces}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, a player can hit after splitting Aces (usually \code{FALSE}, meaning split Aces get only one card). Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{allow_blackjack_after_split}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, a 10-value card dealt to a split Ace counts as a natural Blackjack (usually \code{FALSE}, counting as a standard 21). Default is \code{FALSE}.}
