The goal of **blackjacksim** is to make it easy to play and analyze blackjack directly from the R console. Users can experiment with custom strategies, modify dealer and table rules, and simulate large numbers of hands to estimate performance. This package offers a reproducible environment for studying how blackjack outcomes change under different playing decisions and game conditions.
